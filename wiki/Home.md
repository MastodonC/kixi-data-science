This is the MC Data Science wiki.

The current knowledge sharing strategy in our team is described [here](https://witanblog.wordpress.com/2018/01/24/knowledge-sharing-in-the-data-science-team/).

The wiki is going to contain more general guidelines, around our work process - factors that are unlikely to change much from project to project but may help remind us of good practice.
