This is the MC Data Science wiki.

The current knowledge sharing strategy in our team is described [here](https://witanblog.wordpress.com/2018/01/24/knowledge-sharing-in-the-data-science-team/).

The wiki is going to contain more general guidelines, around our work process - factors that are unlikely to change much from project to project but may help remind us of good practice.

Punctual, more detailed update are in [the internal blog](https://witanblog.wordpress.com/tag/data-science/) (use #data-science tag).

A spreadsheet summarizing our experience which will function as a reference [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19mR0EVaqCZfTzIuTyzFAtUbTuDqPUZsDrHuuFx09gW8/edit#gid=0).
