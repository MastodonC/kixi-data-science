This page is to collect topics of general interest which might be interesting to discuss in a group during a Data Science onsite.

### Data science stack
Share opinions on and explore the strengths and weaknesses of our current stack. (conversation between Sunny/Seb/Mike in Clojure juniors)

### Treatment of random events and outliers in social datasets
I'm interested in hearing other team members' opinions, experiences and approaches to handling outliers in datasets. I'd like to talk about when and why it might be sensible to remove observations in the type of social data we regularly work with (as opposed to, say, instrument measurements we know are inherently noisey) and the related topic of if we attempt to account for random external events in model output's uncertainty, how we communicate to clients about uncertainty etc. (Mike)
