# Structure of a data science project

In my limited experience, it's quite hard to give a structure on a data science project, and this seems confirmed by everything I read.

So by Structure I mean "general direction of travel" - but also "what stage are we at doing this task".  Both of these ways of seeing things can help when wondering where to go next.

One of the better answers I've found while looking around is [https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-workflow-or-process-of-a-data-scientist-What-tools-do-they-use](here)

Quoting and adapting, here are the steps below.  Note that on the diagram above the arrows double back, and in fact I suspect there might be arrows missing when doubling back to an earlier step.

### Stage 1: Ask A Question (that matters to your organization)
Skills: science, domain expertise, curiosity, business and product knowledge
Tools: your brain, talking to experts (in and outside your co.), experience

### Stage 2: Get the Data
Skills: data cleaning, querying databases, web scraping, CS stuff

*Note*: For us stage 1 and stage 2 are often simultaneous and interlinked.  There's no use asking a question if the data doesn't contain the information.  The data informs the question, but the question should also be something that matters and has an impact on the customer or group we're working with.

### Stage 3: Explore the Data
Skills: Get to know data, develop hypotheses, patterns? anomalies?

### Stage 4: Model the data
Skills: regression, machine learning, validation, big data

### Stage 5: Communicate the data
Skills: presentation, speaking, visuals, writing

### Stage 6: Implementation
Skills: product management, communication, IO psychology, CS, politics.
Stage 6 is hugely important. Data Scientists who don’t carry their work all the way through to realize it’s full impact are ultimately just ineffective consultants.
You probably can’t implement it on your own. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t your job to communicate, collaborate, and convince until it is implemented. Champion your work—no one else knows how.

### Stage 7: Test and quantify your impact
Skills: all of the above.
Did Stage 6 work? Was this project worthwhile?
